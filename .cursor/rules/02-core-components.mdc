# Core Components

The core functionality of CarbonSense is implemented through these key components:

## Multi-Agent System

The [crew_agent.py](mdc:src/carbonsense/core/crew_agent.py) file contains the multi-agent system implementation powered by CrewAI, which orchestrates specialized agents for different tasks in the carbon footprint analysis pipeline.

## Carbon Agent

The [carbon_agent.py](mdc:src/carbonsense/core/carbon_agent.py) file implements the main agent responsible for processing carbon footprint queries, including product extraction, database searching, and response generation.

## Embedding Generation

The [embedding_generator.py](mdc:src/carbonsense/core/embedding_generator.py) file handles the creation of vector embeddings for document chunks, supporting multiple IBM Watsonx embedding models.

## RAG Generation

The [rag_generator.py](mdc:src/carbonsense/core/rag_generator.py) file implements the Retrieval-Augmented Generation functionality, combining retrieved context with language model generation.

## YAML Configuration Management

The [yaml_manager.py](mdc:src/carbonsense/core/yaml_manager.py) file provides utilities for loading and managing YAML-based configuration for agents, tasks, and prompts.
