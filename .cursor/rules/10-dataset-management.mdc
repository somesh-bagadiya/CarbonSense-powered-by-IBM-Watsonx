# Dataset Management and Processing

CarbonSense uses specialized datasets for carbon footprint analysis that are processed through a multi-stage pipeline to prepare them for vector embedding and retrieval.

## Dataset Organization

- Raw datasets: [backup-dataset/](mdc:backup-dataset/)
- Processed datasets: [Data_processed/](mdc:Data_processed/)
- Advanced processed datasets: [Data_processed_2/](mdc:Data_processed_2/)
- Generated embeddings: [Embeddings/](mdc:Embeddings/)

## Dataset Categories

The carbon footprint data is organized into four main categories:

- **Electricity**: Power generation and consumption emissions
- **Industry**: Manufacturing and industrial process emissions
- **Regional**: Geographic and location-specific emissions data
- **Metadata**: Supporting information and context for the datasets

## Processing Pipeline

The dataset processing pipeline includes:
1. Data validation and cleaning
2. Standardization of units and metrics
3. Chunking strategies for effective embedding
4. Embedding generation using various IBM Watsonx models
5. Storage in vector databases for efficient retrieval
