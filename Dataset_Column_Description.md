## Data Processing

The dataset undergoes several processing steps before being used in the system:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Standardization of unit formats
   - Handling of missing values
   - Removal of duplicate entries
   - Normalization of text fields

2. **Semantic Enhancement**
   - Generation of vector embeddings for each data chunk
   - Storage in Milvus vector database
   - Metadata tagging for improved retrieval

3. **Usage in System**
   - Retrieved during user queries about carbon footprints
   - Combined with web search results when needed
   - Validated against multiple sources for accuracy
   - Cached to improve performance of repeated queries

## Data Sources

The datasets are compiled from multiple reliable sources including:

- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- Department of Energy (DOE)
- Academic research publications
- Industry sustainability reports
- International environmental organizations
