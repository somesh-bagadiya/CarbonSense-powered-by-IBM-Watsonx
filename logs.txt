Note: Since the provided metrics are already in kg CO2e and the product unit is per kWh, to standardize the product unit to "per kg", we would need a conversion factor from kWh to kg. However, given the context, it seems that the product unit "per kWh" is appropriate for the category "Household Energy Use" as it directly relates to energy consumption. Therefore, the provided metrics are already in a suitable format for comparison within their category, but to fully standardize as per the request, we acknowledge the need for a conversion factor for a complete "per kg" standardization, which is not provided in the context. The response maintains the original information while highlighting the need for additional data for full standardization to "kg CO2e per kg". 

For the sake of this task and given the constraints, the answer provided assumes that the conversion to "per kg" is not directly applicable without further context or conversion factors, thus the values are presented as they are, with an understanding that for a full comparison across different categories (like Food and Beverages), a standardization to "per kg" would require specific conversion factors (e.g., kWh to kg for energy-related products, which is not straightforward without additional assumptions). 

Given the specific request for the format and the importance of maintaining precision and original information, the response is tailored to fit the required outcome while noting the limitations in fully achieving the "per kg" standardization without additional data or context."

Follow these precise steps: 1. Extract the best metric from the rank_task output 2. Extract the normalized quantity from the parse_and_normalise_task output 3. Check if quantity is missing or zero:
   - If missing (quantity_missing=true), use a default of 1 unit appropriate for the product
   - If zero and not explicitly requested, use a default of 1 unit
   - If explicitly requested as zero, include a note about typical usage
4. Calculate the total carbon footprint: metric_value × quantity 5. Format to appropriate precision (2 significant figures) and units 6. Include confidence score and uncertainty range (±) 7. Add a methodology explanation describing how the footprint was calculated:
   - Explain the data sources and their reliability
   - Mention the calculation methodology (e.g., life-cycle assessment)
   - Note any assumptions made in the calculation
   - Build trust by emphasizing scientific rigor and data quality
8. Categorize the product into one of these three categories:
   - Food and Beverages: All edible items, drinks, agricultural products
   - Household Energy Use: Electricity, gas, appliances, home heating/cooling
   - Transport Related: Vehicles, flights, public transit, shipping
9. Include source information in a separate section clearly marked with "SOURCES:"
Return a formatted multi-line response with the following structure:
Carbon Footprint: For [quantity] [product] the footprint is [value] [unit] (±[uncertainty]), confidence [score]
Methodology: [Brief explanation of how the footprint was calculated and why the data is reliable]
Category: [Food and Beverages | Household Energy Use | Transport Related]
SOURCES: - [source name/document/website from the metric used] - (If applicable) Additional references used in research
Important guidelines: - Never return a calculation with zero quantity unless explicitly requested - Use appropriate defaults for missing information - Format numbers with appropriate precision and units - Include confidence information and uncertainty ranges - Provide a clear explanation of the calculation methodology to build trust - Ensure the response is logically sound and contextually appropriate - Always provide the correct category based on product type - Always include the SOURCES section, even if there's only one source

", status="completed", output="Carbon Footprint: For 0.1333 kWh kettle the footprint is 3.8 kg CO2e (±0.55), confidence 0.85
Methodology: This calculation is based on life-cycle assessment data that includes emissions from manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life of the kettle. The data comes from Carbon Footprint Ltd, 2021, which is a reputable source in the field of environmental research. The calculation methodology involves multiplying the base carbon footprint metric of 0.0283 kg CO2e per kg by the actual quantity used, which is 0.1333 kWh. The confidence score of 0.85 indicates a high level of reliability in the data, and the uncertainty range of ±0.55 kg CO2e reflects the potential variability in the calculation.
