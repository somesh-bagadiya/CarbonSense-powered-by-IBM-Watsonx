Your goal is to identify: 1. The product being referenced 2. The quantity and unit specified (if any)
user query: What is the carbon footprint of 5 plastic bottles?
Example input query: "What is the carbon footprint of 2 kg of coffee?"
You should extract and return: - product: coffee - quantity: 2 kg
Output must follow this format: "product: [product], quantity: [quantity]"
If the quantity is not explicitly mentioned, output: "product: [product], quantity: not specified"
This structured output will be used by other agents to compute total carbon emissions.
