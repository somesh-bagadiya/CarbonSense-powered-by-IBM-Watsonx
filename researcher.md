The carbon footprint of bananas is a complex issue that involves various factors such as production, transportation, and consumption. According to some studies, the average carbon footprint of a banana is around 0.15-0.20 kg CO2e per banana, with the majority of emissions coming from transportation and production. However, these values can vary greatly depending on factors such as the country of origin, transportation methods, and farming practices. To reduce the carbon footprint of bananas, sustainable farming practices, efficient transportation methods, and reducing food waste can be implemented. Additionally, governments and international organizations can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable food systems and reducing the carbon footprint of banana production and trade.
