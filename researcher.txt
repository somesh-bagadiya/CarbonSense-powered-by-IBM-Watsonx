**Detailed Research Report: Carbon Footprint of Apple**

**1. Primary Carbon Footprint Data:**
The carbon footprint of an apple is approximately 0.047335 kg CO2e per unit, according to the Food_Global.xlsx database. This value represents the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, processing, and transportation of apples.

**2. Environmental Impact Statistics:**
In addition to the carbon footprint, apples also have other environmental impacts, such as water usage and land use. However, these statistics are not readily available in the provided data sources. Further research would be necessary to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of apples.

**3. Sources and References:**
The primary source of data for this report is the Food_Global.xlsx database, which provides carbon footprint information for various food products, including apples. Other sources, such as Food_USA.xlsx, also contain relevant data, but the values are not significantly different from those found in Food_Global.xlsx.

**4. Confidence Levels in the Data:**
The confidence level in the data is moderate, with a score of 0.5424, indicating that the results are reasonably reliable. However, it is essential to note that the data sources are limited, and more comprehensive research would be necessary to increase the confidence level.

In conclusion, the carbon footprint of an apple is approximately 0.047335 kg CO2e per unit, according to the available data sources. While this value provides a general idea of the environmental impact of apples, further research is necessary to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
