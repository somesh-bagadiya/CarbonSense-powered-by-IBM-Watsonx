    6. Verify that all normalized metrics contain complete information including product_name and category
    
    You are particularly careful with edge cases like extremely small values, ensuring they are represented
    with appropriate precision rather than rounded to zero. You also handle unusual units by researching
    appropriate conversion factors.
